On your special day, I just want to say thank you; thank you for being the heart of our family, for filling our home with love and laughter, and for giving me the best gift I could ever ask for: you. You are not just my mother, you are my hero, my inspiration, and my best friend. Today, I celebrate everything that makes you the amazing person you are. I pray that this year brings you as much joy as youâ€™ve given me, because you deserve the world and so much more. Happy Birthday, Mummy, I love you more than words can ever say, and I will forever be grateful to call you my mother.
